        <h2>Core Topic: Real Number System</h2>
        <p>Unit I covers the fundamental properties of the **Real Number System** ($\mathbb{R}$), including order properties and the concept of **Absolute Value**. Key concepts include the **l.u.b. axiom** (least upper bound) and **g.l.b.** (greatest lower
            bound).</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Unit II: Sequences of Real Numbers</h3>
        <p>We explore the definition and convergence of sequences. A crucial theorem is that **every convergent sequence is bounded**.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Unit III: Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)</h3>
        <p>This unit deals with solving **Linear Differential Equations** and **Exact Differential Equations**, focusing on applications like Newton's Law of Cooling.</p>
